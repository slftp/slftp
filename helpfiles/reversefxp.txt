Usage: <cmd> <sitename> <mode> <value>
Description: Enables reverse FXP for the given site and direction.
If <value> (or <value> and <mode>) is omitted, the currently set value is displayed.

Parameters:
<sitename>
  Site name
<mode>
  -s/--source use reverse FXP if the given site is the source
  -d/--destination use reverse FXP if the given site is the destination
<value>
  '1' to enable, '0' to disable reverse FXP

Examples:
Enable reverse FXP if SITE is the source
!reversefxp SITE -s 1

Description:
Usually when FXPing, the source site enters passive mode and the destination site
uses the PORT command to connect to the source site. If reverse FXP is enabled for
either source or destination site, this will be reversed and the destination site
will use passive mode instead.

For example if a site is behind NAT and therefore can't use passive mode, you
would want to use reverse FXP if that site is the source.
