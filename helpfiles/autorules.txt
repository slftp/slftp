Get/sets/Remove autorules status of a site.
Usage: <cmd> sitename interval
Autorules read the siterules and let you know if anything has changed.
If interval is zero, autorules is turned off. Interval is seconds.
NOTE: Use a higher interval because rules are not changed every x minutes/hours! It'll only block your sites.
Examples:
<cmd> * 0 <- disable autorules on every site
<cmd> HQ1,HQ2,HQ3 86400 <- checks every 24h if there was a change in rules

You can use the special sitename * as a wildcard for all sites.
