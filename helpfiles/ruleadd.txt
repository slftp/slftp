You can use the special section * for section-generic rules, also * for site-generic rules.
* as sitename and * as section works as well.

Rules are incoming rules only.
If no matching rules found, no action is taken, the release won't be allowed.
If a matching rule found, its action will be taken.
NOTE, order of the rules is important, since the first matching one will apply.

The following order of rules is processed:
1. * * <- global rules for all sites
2. * SECTION <- global section-generic rules
3. SITE * <- site-generic rules
4. SITE SECTION <- site section rules
