Usage: <cmd> sitename1 [value]
Set/Show the reduced_speedstat_weight value for the given input site.
If the value is not configured on a per-site basis, the default global
value from slftp.ini will be used.
If a site has a low rank, but transfers are fast, that site can end up with a high destination priority at races.
If this setting is enabled, speedstats will no longer change this priority over different ranks, but only change order within the same ranks

Valid input for value: 0 or 1

Examples:
<cmd> HQ <- shows current 'reduced speedstat weight' value
<cmd> HQ 1 <- enables 'reduced speedstat weight' for HQ
