Sets/modifes/removes a blowfish key for a channel.
Usage: <cmd> netname #channel [key]
If key is omitted, association is removed.
NOTE: To use the more secure CBC mode, use the prefix 'cbc:' when specifying the key.

Examples:
<cmd> LINKNET #slftp-ecb sj28df38djfie2fj <-- ECB mode
<cmd> LINKNET #slftp-cbc cbc:e8dje2fwwjf3gthsf38 <-- CBC mode

To take effect of changing a key for an already added channel, you have to restart slftp.
