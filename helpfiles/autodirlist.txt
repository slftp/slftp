Scans sections for new rips by dirlisting.
Usage: <cmd> sitename [interval section1 section2 section3 ...]
If interval is zero, autodirlist is turned off. Interval is seconds.
WARNING: use age condition before adding an autodirlist to a not daydir based section
else you will get a HUGE backfill
Note: autodirlist starts races automaticly, its not affected by the 
<cmdprefix>auto command.
Note: special section REQUEST is handled differently, if a site has REQUEST section
added to autodirlist, bot will try filling requests based on rips indexed by the 
autoindex feature.
