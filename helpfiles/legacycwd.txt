Usage: <cmd> sitename1,sitename2,sitename3 [0|1]
If turned on, it uses CWD commands to change dir (recommended for cubnc, drftpd and glftpd v1 sites).
If turned off, bot doesn't change working directory but uses full paths everywhere (recommended for glftpd v2).
If 2nd parameter is omitted, current status is returned.

Example: Remove following file: /inc/x264/rls/myfile.rar
<cmd> HQ 0 <-- uses "DELE /inc/x264/rls/myfile.rar"
<cmd> HQ 1 <-- uses "CWD /inc" + "CWD x264" + "CWD rls" + "DELE myfile.rar"
As you see siteops need to link their dirs against correct $PWD, if they don't, you need to enable legacycwd!

You can use the special sitename * as a wildcard for all sites.
