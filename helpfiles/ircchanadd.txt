Adds a channel to a network.
Usage: <cmd> netname #channel
Use <cmdprefix>ircchandel to remove a channel.
If the channel is not key protected and not invite only,
then it will be joined immediately. If its key protected,
use <cmdprefix>ircchankey to set it. If the channel is
invite only, then use <cmdprefix>sitechan to bind a site
to the irc network.
