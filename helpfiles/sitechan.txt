Binds a site to a network in case it has invite only chan. 
If site's chan is not invite only, delete the network by calling it without netname.
Usage: <cmd> sitename [netname]
Eg.: HQ is a nice site. It even has a sitechan! On Linknet! But its invite only :(
No worries! We just do
<cmd> HQ linknet
and bot will invite itself next time when it connects to linknet.
