Adds a rule for precatcher. Channel must already be configured. See <prefix>ircchanadd and <prefix>ircchanblow
Usage: <cmd> sitename netname channelname botnicks (NEWDIR|PRE|COMPLETE|NUKE|REQUEST|ADDPRE) words [section]
botnicks is a comma separated list of nicks of the bot.
Event can be NEWDIR, PRE, COMPLETE, NUKE, REQUEST or ADDPRE.
Words is a comma seperated list of words which are present in the actual announce line. (case insensitive)
Section is optional, you can use it to force the section (if the announce line doesn't contain it)
Examples:
1.
You probably want to add (at least) three catch rules for each of your sites.
Ok, we have a site called X3, they are very expert guys and customized the theme, 
so they announce pre as squirt and newdir is fisting, 1st file is anal,
race event is gangbang, fuckup means its completed, only idiots fuck animals means it was nuked on site.
Lets add its rules:
<cmd> X3 LINKNET #x3 x3bot PRE squirt <- new pre on site
<cmd> X3 LINKNET #x3 x3bot NEWDIR fisting <- dir created on site
<cmd> X3 LINKNET #x3 x3bot NEWDIR anal <- first file uploaded
<cmd> X3 LINKNET #x3 x3bot NEWDIR gangbang <- other people joined the race
<cmd> X3 LINKNET #x3 x3bot COMPLETE fuckup <- its done
<cmd> X3 LINKNET #x3 x3bot NUKE idiots,fuck,animals <- rls was nuked on site

2.
Another site ABC with newdir and pre line like that:
NEW RACE in TV-SD releasename join in!
We have a new PRE in TV-SD releasename THANKS affilgroup!
Nuked TV-SD releasename for: reason
COMPLETE in TV-SD releasename bye!
We want to add this to site ABC on EFNET as mentioned above:
<cmd> ABC EFNET #abc-main sitebot NEWDIR NEW,RACE,join
<cmd> ABC EFNET #abc-main sitebot PRE new,PRE,thanks
<cmd> ABC EFNET #abc-main sitebot COMPLETE COMPLETE,in,bye
<cmd> ABC EFNET #abc-main sitebot NUKE Nuked,for

Take care that you don't block announce lines with a wrong setup for ignorewords in precatcher.

Note: for iso sites its better if you add rules for events like race, 50% complete etc,
so the bot would know, the race is still in progress or it's being continued (after someone
left it incomplete). Simple add several rules for them as NEWDIR.

Event ADDPRE can be used to fill your pre DB using the precatcher, in case your pre source is not using standard !addpre,!sitepre
