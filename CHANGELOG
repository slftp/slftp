--=========================( NEW SETTINGS AND FILES )==============================-

    NEW slftp.ini parameter(s):

      parse_boxofficemojo_exact=0
      parse_boxofficemojo_always=0
      new_news_announce_interval=3
      dbms=
      complete sections [http], [news] added/changed

    NEW slftp.spamconf parameter(s):
        global_skip_group=1

    NEW rules tvlookupdone/imdblookupdone
      these replace previous imdbyear/tvpremieryear = 0 DROP constructs
      prior to any tv-related rules use "ifnot tvlookupdone then DROP"
      prior to any imdb-related rules use "ifnot imdblookupdone then DROP"
      this ensures the rules are only evaluated once the lookup has been finished
      to prevent wrong trades from being executed based on missing/no information

    1. compare your slftp.ini with the provided one in /dist folder, many changes
    2. update your helpfiles with the provided ones in /dist/help folder
    3. replace your old slftp.languagebase file with the provided one in /dist folder
    4. delete slftp.pem, not needed!
    5. delete slftp.languages, not needed!
    6. delete your old slftp.news file (if existing)
    7. delete your old stats.db file due to a wrong UNIQUE INDEX setting (if existing)
    8. create a folder 'databases' in slftp dir and move your databases into it
    9. if you have problems with reusing existing databases, delete all .db files

--==============================( KNOWN BUGS )====================================-

    OpenSSL v1.1.* isn't supported yet
    Setting !maxupdn to 0 for upload/download leads to problems -> generating gillions of queued tasks
    Statsoutput sometimes screwed -> NEGATIVE BYTES (due to parsing of x-dupe response)
    Dirlist confusion causing wrong skip files output but it does not race them
