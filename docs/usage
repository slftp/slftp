                                Network & Channel Setup
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Admin Network
-------------

You should setup your admin network on a network that has "fakelag" disabled, or the ability to OPER the bot.
As you can imagine there is alot of data to be pasted to channels and you don't want to be kicked
for flooding every time you type !help.

Add an IRC network with direct connection
-----------------------------------------

If you want the bot to connect to your znc bouncer, look at section 1.2.

Begin by editing the slftp.ini file and enter the nickname you wish to have.

Then it's time to add a connection to a IRC network.

	# !ircnetadd <IRCNETWORKNAME> <host>:<port> <sslmode on/off>

Example:

	# !ircnetadd LINKNET eu.link-net.org:7000 1

*** sslmode is 0 or 1

Now you have the bot on linknet. And you can add further irc networks for other sites.

Check if the bot is connected

	# !ircstatus

Add an IRC network with ZNC
---------------------------

Making your bot connect to your ZNC bouncer is simple. Using ZNC is useful when you only want one user visible
on channel, both the one you chat from and your bot. It is also useful if you want to have different nicknames
on different irc networks, as the current version of slftp only allows one irc nickname for all the servers.

	# !ircnetadd <IRCNETWORKNAME> <host>:<port> <sslmode on/off> <user:password> [<nickname>]

Example:

	# !ircnetadd SexyBnc irc.znc.bouncer.com:1337 1 myznc:easilycracked

Example if you have multiple networks configured in ZNC:

	# !ircnetadd SexyBnc irc.znc.bouncer.com:1337 1 myznc/zncnetworkname:easilycracked

For further information check the help

	# !help ircnetadd

Check if the bot is connected

	# !ircstatus

IRC channels and blowfish
-------------------------

Adding IRC channels
-------------------

After you have created your irc networks you need to add irc channels for the bot to join.

	# !ircchanadd <IRCNETWORKNAME> <channel>

Example:

	# !ircchanadd LINKNET #channel

IRC channel passwords

If the irc channel requires a password:

	# !ircchankey <IRCNETWORKNAME> <channel> <key>

Example:

	# !ircchankey LINKNET #channel mysecretkey

IRC channel fish keys
---------------------
If your channel requires a fish key
NOTE: If you are using fish in your znc you can skip this step.
      If you are setting up a admin channel, blowfish is REQUIRED to be set in slftp.

	# !ircchanblow <IRCNETWORKNAME> <channel> <blowfishkey>

ECB and CBC blowfish keys are supported. To indicate that a key is to be used for CBC
encryption, prefix the key with cbc: to maintain compatibility with other scripts.
It is highly recommended to use CBC whenever possible!

Example:

	# !ircchanblow LINKNET #channel cbc:feI2J$d38JF3t%fKEmdWoFDj4N)emFj3F3

Adding sites
------------

Now it's time to add sites

	# !addsite <SITENAME> <user> <password> <ip>:<port>

Example:

	# !addsite SITENAME buck angel 127.0.0.1:6969

In case your site has more than one bnc's you can add more bnc's with the !addbnc command

	# !addbnc SITENAME 192.168.1.1:6969

Adding sections
---------------

slFtp has default section names for releases which you can see under the [sections] in the slftp.precatcher file,
you can edit it as you like. It's highly recommended to become familiar with the file as it will make your life
so much easier when using slFtp.

For a small example as a short introduction to the sections take a look at the following:

Under my [slftp.precatcher] I have:

ISOAPPS=ISOAPPS,APPS,ISO APPS,APPS ISO
ISOGAMES=ISOGAMES,ISO GAMES,GAMES ISO,GAMES

This means that whenever something is uploaded to the sections that have GAMES in their name, will be put into the section ISOGAMES

So if you want to race games to a site you need to add the section ISOGAMES to that particular site.

NOTE: You can skip this step and just use !setdir SITENAME ISOGAMES /GAMES/ which will set the directory for that section
      on this site and also add the section ISOGAMES to the site, the same way !sections would.

We add the section with the following command:

	# !sections <sitename> <section>

Example:

	# !sections SITENAME ISOGAMES

To remove sections, just run the same !section command again with the name of the section you wish to remove

	# !sections SITENAME ISOGAMES

To see all the sections you have added you can use the !sections command

	# !sections SITENAME


Mapping sections
----------------

After you have set up your sections as you like them you might want to look at [mapping] under the slftp.precatcher file.
It is going to help you sort out what goes where. Here we have a small example.

	ISOGAMES;CLONEGAMES;*clone*,*clonedvd*,*clones*
	ISOGAMES;MACGAMES;*MAC*,*MACOSX*,*OSX*,*MACOS*,*APPLE*

This means that everything that comes into ISOGAMES with the name MACOS or MAC will be mapped to a section that's called MACGAMES.

So if any of my sites allows MACGAMES, then I'll just have to add the MACGAMES section to it.

	# !section SITENAME MACGAMES

You could put everything under ISOGAMES but as some sites don't allow clone then it's necessary to map clone to another section.

Here are some further examples for mapping, if you understand the mapping you can probably figure out what is being done here.

	0DAY;PDA;*.SymbianOS*,*-*PDA,*.WM2003.*,*.XScale.*,*.J2Me*,*.PalmOS.*
	0DAY;EBOOK;*.EBOOK-*,*.EBOOK.*,ActualTests.*,*.Exam.Q.*
	X264;HD720;*.720p.*,*.720p-*
	X264;HD1080;*.1080p.*,*.1080p-*
	ISOAPPS;ISOTRAINING;*Lynda.com.*,*VTC.*,*Total.Training*,*TRAINSIGNAL.*,*Train.Signal*
	MDVDR;MHD;*.1080p.*,*.1080p-*,*.720p.*,*.720p-*,*.x264.*,*.x264-*

NOTE: For a more detailed explanation of the precatcher please see the docs/precatcher file.

Set directories
---------------

Once you have set your sections you need to set your directories so that slftp knows where to put the files
that are going into that particular section.

This is done with the !setdir command

	# !setdir <sitename> <section> <directory>

NOTE: The <section> is the default section in the precatcher file, not the sitebot sections.

Examples:

	# !setdir SITENAME MACGAMES /MACGAMES
	# !setdir SITENAME MP3 /MP3-TODAY

Once you have set all your directories you can use the !site command to get a overview of all the sections/directories you have set, useful to see if you are forgetting something.

	# !site SITENAME


Add precatcher
--------------

Next we need to add a precatcher to catch the announce from the sitebot.
There are a few ways to do this, so I suggest you read the precatcher file so you know what your doing,
and can make a decision on what suits you best.

Valid events are NEWDIR | PRE | COMPLETE | NUKE | REQUEST but you really only need NEWDIR

	# !catchadd <SITE> <IRCNETWORKNAME> <#channel> <botname> <event> <words>
	# For more examples run: !help catchadd

Example:

	# !catchadd SITENAME LINKNET #trannychan trannybot NEWDIR cum,in,my,ass

To see if your precatcher works and actually catches announces you can use the !catchtest command.

Example:

	# !catchtest LINKNET #trannychan trannybot ( xxx|cum ) . Tranny.Grannys.20.XXX.DVDRip.XviD-SiCKFUCK . fag/iND
	# |Process LINKNET #trannychan trannybot ( xxx|cum ) . Tranny.Grannys.20.XXX.DVDRip.XviD-SiCKFUCK . fag/iND
	# |ProcessRelease Tranny.Grannys.20.XXX.DVDRip.XviD-SiCKFUCK iND NEWDIR
	# |Cleanedup line wo rlsname: xxx cum fag iND
	# |Section: XXX
	# |Event: NEWDIR
	# |Ok.


Adding rules
------------

Now it's time to set up some rules to filter out what you want to trade, and what you want to skip.
You add the rules for the site you want to trade to (the destination).

Available rules
---------------

It's best to get familiar with the available rules so you can decide what you need to do. To see available rules:

	# !rulelist

To see how a particular rule functions:

	# !rulehelp rulename

Rule operators
--------------

Another thing you need to get familiar with are the rule operators, some basic knowledge that * is a wildcard is also good.
Knowing regex might also come in handy.

Operators:

	= simple equality test
	!= simple inequality test
	=~ mask match with wildchar support. Eg.: releasename =~ *-BERC
	=~ regex match. Eg.: releasename =~ /-(BERC|BERG)$/
	!~ not mask/regex match
        in list operator, matches any items in the list. Eg.: mp3source in TAPE, VINYL
	< <= >= > comparator for e.g. mp3year or other integer ranges
	@ equality match but it expects SITENAME as parameter 

You can use the special section * for section-generic rules, also * for site-generic rules.

Creating rules
--------------

Now that you've gotten yourself familiar with the available rules, operators and hopefully familiarised yourself
with the requirements of the site ("site rules" in most cases) you need to create a list of rules.
The order of the rules is important, the first matching (ALLOW) rule will apply.
The exception to this rule is global rules. They will ALWAYS be put first regardless of the rule number.

If our site allows everything in a section we just need one rule.

	# !ruleadd SITENAME XXX if default then ALLOW

Note that every other rule we'd add after that rule would get ignored, since we just allowed everything.

It's best to rule out what's forbidden (DROP) and then allow the rest. Always try and do drop rules as much as possible rather than ALLOW.
Let's say our site only allows scripted tv shows from the UK and the USA.

	# !ruleadd SITENAME TV-720 ifnot tvlookupdone then DROP
	# !ruleadd SITENAME TV-720 if tvcountry notin USA, UK then DROP
	# !ruleadd SITENAME TV-720 ifnot tvscripted then DROP
	# !ruleadd SITENAME TV-720 if default then ALLOW

The tvlookupdone rule ensures the rest of the rules are only evaluated after the tvmaze lookup has been performed.
Since information like tvcountry and tvscripted is only known after the lookup has been performed.
Prior to the lookup the release will be reported as dropped due to tvlookupdone. After a tvmaze lookup has been performed
an UPDATE event is issued which will re-evaluate the rules based on the newly available tv information.

Another example where our site only allows non/foreign reggae MP3's ripped from cd, vinyl, web that's newer than 2009

	# !ruleadd SITENAME MP3 if mp3genre =~ *reggae* || mp3genre =~ *Dance Hall* || mp3genre =~ *dancehall* then DROP
	# !ruleadd SITENAME MP3 if not mp3language in en then DROP
	# !ruleadd SITENAME MP3 if not ( mp3source in CD, CDR, Vinyl, WEB ) then DROP
	# !ruleadd SITENAME MP3 if mp3year < 2009 then DROP
	# !ruleadd SITENAME MP3 if default then ALLOW

NOTE: In order for tvmaze, mp3/flac, imdb etc lookups to work you MUST set these slftp sections in your slftp.ini file under [kb].
      Don't put sections in more than one line, it'll only use first appearance of them and this leads to problems with rules! 
	TMP3Release=MP3,FLAC
	T0dayRelease=0-DAY,0-DAY-PDA,0-DAY-GAMES
	TTVRelease=TV,TV-DVDRIP,TV-BLURAY,TV-DVDR,TV-HR,TV-WMV,TV-X264,TV-SDX264,TV-XVID,TV-SPORT
	TNFORelease=X265    # supports only Genre parsing!
	TMVIDRelease=MVID,MDVDR
	TIMDBRelease=XVID,X264,DVDR,BLURAY

NOTE: The rules imdblookupdone (for TIMDBRelease), tvlookupdone (for TTVRelease) and mvidlookupdone (for TMVIDRelease) are available to be able to stop
      rule evaluation of rules before the respective lookups have been performed (and as such would only yield invalid results for rules)

Testing your rules
------------------

You can test your rules by looking up existing releases on a site and see if they are matched or not,
or you can just wait for the next release to be caught.
I strongly advise that you test your rules with existing releases, not all siteops are keen on trial runs.

Begin by looking up the release

	# !lookup SITENAME XXX Tranny.Grannys.20.XXX.DVDRip.XviD-SiCKFUCK

then see the info on the release

	# !kbshow XXX Tranny.Grannys.20.XXX.DVDRip.XviD-SiCKFUCK


Add routes
----------

Now that the basic stuff has been set up, it's time to decide what sites trade where, we do that with routes.
You can manually set the number [1-9].
This is just the initial setup of weights for trading between sites.
slFtp will re-calculate the routes according to speed, time and ranking regularly.

If you want to read more on this look at the docs/chains file.

	# !routeset sitefrom siteto 9

For example if we want to trade stuff from SITE1 to SITE2 and then from SITE2 to SITE1 aswell

	# !routeset SITE1 SITE2 9
	# !routeset SITE2 SITE1 9

This can also be accomplished by doing

	# !routeset SITE1 SITE2 9 -b

Be sure to check out !rulehelp routeset for more examples and options this command offers.


Turn on auto
------------

Last but not least, turn on the auto

	# !auto 1
