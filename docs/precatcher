                                   Precatcher
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are two ways to feed slFtp with race events:
- using an external precatcher which sends the events in UDP packets (see 1)
- making the bot join the sitechans and using the builtin precatcher (see 2)
This doc file is about the 2nd way.

1)
* NOTE: This method isn't maintained nor really tested - try out yourself *
Currently only mIRC dll plugin is implemented.
Installation:
- copy mirktrade.dll to mirc dir
- copy mirktrade.conf to mirc dir
- edit slftp.ini, enable external precatcher support in [eprecatcher]
  set a port to listen on
- edit ip:port in mirktrade.conf, set the same
- edit password in mirktrade.conf
- copy mirktrade_(fish|mirccryption).mrc into mirc dir
- add channels/botnicks/etc into mirktrader.conf's []
- /load -rs1 mirktrade_(fish|mirccryption).mrc

Commands you can use now:
/con       - enable precatching
/coff      - disable precatching
/creload   - reparse mirktrader.conf
/ctest     - similar functionality as !catchtest for the builtin precatch, 
             read !help catchtest (and omit netname parameter)


2)			 
                               How precatcher works
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When an irc line is catched from an added source (ircnet-#channel-botname),
the following steps are being done:
- color codes, text decorations and other control characters are stripped
  basicly only a..z, A..Z, 0..9, ( ) _ - . & are left, others are substituted 
  to whitespace (focsupaszitas)
- extracting the longest phrase of the announce with at least 1 - the name 
  this is the release name.
- replacefrom/replaceto substitutions are executed
- looking for nukewords (if any of them is found, execution is stopped)
- tagline processing is being executed... some sites announce user tagline
  as a moto... which might cause some problems when detecting genre of an
  mp3 release or similar. if a "tagline" word is found in the announce,
  rest words are stripped.
  this features is useful for example:
  "mp3 done in fooooobar-foobar-2009-grp by raceruser moto i am a 
  motherfucer metal head"
  this could have been announced as a metal rip of fooooobar-foobar-2009-grp
  which is invalid, since the word "metal" is not a genre but belongs to
  the motherfucker user. See slftp.precathcer, tagline
- trying to recognize the section. Based on the aliases in [sections].
  For eg. the config line "0DAY=0DAY,0 DAY,0 DAYS,0DAYS" means the irc 
  announce line will be checked for 0DAY, "0 DAY", "0 DAYS" and 0DAYS phrases.
  Notice the space between 0 and DAY. The reason is:
  Some sites announce events like [0DAY-COMPLETE], and the COMPLETE event was
  not catched. So a substituion in replacefrom/to was added to change - into
  a whitespace. This way the event parser can find the word COMPLETE. 
  (Read more about event parser below)
  This has a side effect, some sites which announce section names with a -
  in the name, will look diffent, for eg. "0-DAY NEWDIR" will become 
  "0 DAY NEWDIR". This is the the reason why there is a "0 DAY" alias in the
  section config.
  Extracting the section is case INsensitive, and it needs full word match.
  For example: if the announce line contains 0DAYCRAP it wont be recognized.
  When a section alias is found, the release will get the main section name 
  (at the beginning of the config line, before the = sign)
- Since some sites announce the section name in the NEWDIR event but later 
  not anymore, slftp maintanes a releasename/section name cache (sectionhelper)
  If the section name couldnt be extracted, this cache will be looked up.
- Section name mapping is being executed based on the [mappings] config.
  This is useful if you want to remap your 0DAY stuffs to PDA or movie stuffs
  to some localized section name.
  Mapping syntax is:
  old section name;new section name;mask1[,mask2[,mask3...]]
  If "old section name" is empty string, it matches every section.
  "New section name" is the section the release will be mapped to. It is required.
  Masks is a comma seperated list of masks, read MASKS.
  Processing of mappings does not stop at the first match, but it is 
  being continued til end of mapping rules.
- If there is still no section name, No section?! error will be announced and
  precatcher stops processing.
- MP3 genre parsing is being executed based on slftp.ini's [kb] mp3_genres 
  (or mirktrade.conf's embedded list in case of using mirktrade.dll)
- Event parsing is being executed, which basicly means, slftp is looking for 
  some builtin words to modify event to PRE (pre) or COMPLETE 
  (complete, completed, ended, done, end)
- sitename/section/genre/event data is sent to the kb, which will fire the 
  site rulesets and start transfers if its needed.
- Regex support - dont know what to say.. its easy ha..
