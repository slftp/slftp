                                 Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Edit slftp.ini
2a. Decide between using pre-compiled binaries or self-compiling
    For information about self-compiling please see file "compiling"
2b. Get all relevant libraries into the same folder as your binary
    For Windows all relevant libraries are shipped with the package
    For Linux you need to compile/download libraries on your own
    See file "compiling" and/or use libinstaller.sh script
2c. Start the binary (./slftp_x86, ./slftp_x64, slftp_x64.exe or slftp_x86.exe)
 3. Enter a password. The password you use the first time will be your master
   pass, used for all the cipher operations.
 4. Learn !help
 5. Add sites (!help addsite)
 6. Setup section dirs (!help setdir)
 7. Setup routes (!help setspeed inroutes outroutes)
 8. Add networks, chans (!help ircnetadd, !help ircchanadd, !help ircchankey, !help ircchanblow)
 9. Add precatcher rules (!help catchadd)
10. Add site rules (!help ruleadd)
11. Turn on auto !auto 1


If there is a race event on a site generated by the precatcher, its outgoing
routing table will be walkthroughed (ordered by weights) and all the sites 
which have the same section, will be checked against the ruleset,
if the actual release is allowed there.
This way a dynamic chain will be generated and the actual file transfer is 
being started. When all the tasks are finished, race stat based on the 
actual file hits of the race will be announced on the control channel.

Note:
- If a section is not set up in slftp.precatcher, precatcher wont send the 
  event to the KB.
- If a section is not added to a site, slFtp will skip racing the rip there.
- If there is no route specified between two sites, files wont be sent
  directly.
- If a section is not set up in slftp.skip, then the general skiplist will
  be applied, which means, every file is allowed but the few being on the
  hardcoded blacklist, which are zero byte files, files beginning with "."
  and ftprush like dupes with (1) at the end of the basename.

About rules:
Lets see having site S with MP3 rules like this:
200- #1. PRETIME: 60 min                                               [NUKE x3]
200- #2. Years: 2006 +                                                 [NUKE x3]
200- #3. All languages allowed                                                  
200- #4. Max 3 CD's                                                    [NUKE x3]
200- #5. Allowed sources: CD, CDS, CDR, DVD, Vinyl                     [NUKE x3]
200- #6. Banned types: Audiobook, Bootleg                              [NUKE x3]
200- #7. Whitelisted groups (ALL allowed from them):
200-     GRP1, GRP2, GRP3                                              
200- #8. Whitelisted genres (All years):
200-     Techno, Trance, Electronic                                     


Lets see how to setup this:
Tho rules dont mention it, we add some failure groups to the blacklist:
  !ruleadd sitename MP3 if group in EOSINT, FiH then DROP
We also add internal rips to blacklist, as HQ's dont want them unless specified:
  !ruleadd sitename MP3 if internal then DROP
Ok, lets drop old stuff, as rule #1 wants it:
  !ruleadd sitename MP3 if age > 3600 then DROP
slftp.kb is an internal database which keeps track about rips predate.

Lets see an example:
Site A and site B both have MP3 sections. New Prodigy album was raced to A, so it's
added to KB. Site B was down meanwhile, due to an upgrade. A few days later B comes
back, silly siteop starts backfilling Prodigy to the current daydir. But we won't
send it to A, as we recognized it being old stuff based on the KB...

Ok, lets continue rules. Rule #3 is something we don't need to care about.

Note rule #7, it basicly means rule #4, #5 and #6 don't affect those groups! So we add:
  !ruleadd sitename MP3 if group in GRP1, GRP2, GRP3 then ALLOW

Now lets drop 3cd stuffs based on Rule #4:
  !ruleadd sitename MP3 if mp3numdisks > 3 then DROP

Rule #5 is tricky, we need to negate the condition:
  !ruleadd sitename MP3 ifnot mp3source in CD, CDS, CDR, DVD, Vinyl then DROP

Lets also filter stuff based on type (rule #6):
  !ruleadd sitename MP3 if mp3type in audiobook, bootleg then DROP

We now add the whitelisted genres which are not affected by the year rule:
  !ruleadd sitename MP3 if mp3genre in Techno, Trance, Electronic then ALLOW

Then lets drop old stuff as rule #2 wants:
  !ruleadd sitename MP3 if mp3year < 2006 then DROP

And at this step we already dropped everything that the site does not want!
This also means that everything else is allowed:
  !ruleadd sitename MP3 if default then ALLOW
