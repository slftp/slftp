FPC 3.2 is in BETA stadium which gets fixes from time to time and
FPC 3.3 is a moving target where changes are added almost every day.

Even if you have a working version installed, you should update it
from time to time for improvements and/or fixed bugs inside the
compiler, libraries, etc which might also affect slFtp.

For downloading details, see https://www.freepascal.org/develop.html

1. Install latest official FPC version 
    see https://www.freepascal.org/download.var and 'compiling' file

    e.g. for Debian:
      echo "deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian stretch-backports main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
      apt-get update -y
      apt-get install fpc-3.0.4 screen binutils libncurses-dev libncursesw5-dev libssl-dev libncurses5 libncursesw5-dbg unzip -y

    e.g. for Arch Linux:
      pacman -S fpc
