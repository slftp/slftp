                                  NUKEBOT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
slFtp has nukebot feature since version 1.2.0.4: you can use it to nuke the same
releases with the same reason on several sites. slFtp maintains a nuke queue, it
is saved to file, so nukes wont be skipped if a site is temp down (not even when
you restart the bot in the meantime).

How to use it?

1. You need to setup the section dir on each site first. 
  !setdir HQ1 MP3 /MP3/<yyyy>-<mm><dd>/
  !setdir HQ2 MP3 /MP3/<mm><dd>/
The <> macros will be changed with the given date on nuke event.
Macros you can use: 
  <yyyy>: four digit year
    <yy>: last two digits of <yyyy>
    <mm>: two digits month (with leading zero)
    <dd>: two digits day of month (with leading zero)
    <ww>: week of year (with leading zero)
Of course you can setup static path if section is not dated.

2. You need to enable nuking on each site.
  !autonuke HQ1 900
  !autonuke HQ2 900
This means, slFtp will check the nuke queue every 15 minutes and nuke releases.
If you want immediate action, you can use 1 second interval.

3. Actual nuking, some examples:
- Nuking todays release on each site:
  !nuke MP3 Foo-Bar-2009-ABORTED 3 Reencode crap.
This will nuke the ABORTED release on HQ1 and HQ2 in todays dir with multiplier of 3.

- Nuking release pred on a specific time on each site:
  !nuke MP3 2009-05-01 Foo-Bar-2009-ABORTED 3 Reencode crap.
This will nuke the ABORTED release on HQ1 (/MP3/2009-0501) and on HQ2 (/MP3/0501).

- Nuking release on a specific site only:
  !nuke HQ2 MP3 2009-05-01 Foo-Bar-2009-ABORTED 3 Reencode crap.
This will nuke the ABORTED release on HQ2 (/MP3/0501).

You can use !unnuke with almost the same syntax (without multiplier) to unnuke releases.

4. If you want an IRC based nuke channel, you need to enable this ACL:
!ircchanrole LINKNET #myprivatenukechan NUKE
Note: channel MUST have a blowfish key.
