                                PREBOT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
slFtp was originally written as a pretool for group usage.
This functionality has been maintained over the years and in parts extended to
accommodate advanced usage.
This document is meant to outline how to use the prebot functionality and how
to set it up correctly.

1. Set up your dump and/or pre-sites as you would with any normal site

2. Set up predirs on those sites
  You can just use the normal !setdir cmd or use the separate !setpredir cmd
  we provide that has some additional checks.
  Sections for preing need to be prefixed with PRE. Whether you use - to
  separate elements is up to you.

  Syntax: !setpredir <site> <section> <predirpath>

  How you set up your predirs depends a bit on what the sites you pre on force
  you to use or adhere to.

  Example: All your presites have central PRE folders and you only pre MP3
    You could also just use PRE as a section in this setup, but why not keep
    our options open :)
    !setpredir DUMP PRE-MYGRP /pres/
    !setpredir SITE1 PRE-MYGRP /groups/MYGRP/
    !setpredir SITE2 PRE-MYGRP /_PRE/MYGRP/

  Example: Presites have section-based PRE folders and/or you pre to different
    sections with your group.
    !setpredir DUMP PRE-TV-720 /pres/
    !setpredir DUMP PRE-TV-1080 /pres/
    !setpredir DUMP PRE-X264-720 /pres/
    !setpredir DUMP PRE-X264-1080 /pres/
    !setpredir SITE1 PRE-TV-720 /tv720/_pre/
    !setpredir SITE1 PRE-TV-1080 /tv1080/_pre/
    !setpredir SITE1 PRE-X264-720 /720/_pre/
    !setpredir SITE1 PRE-X264-1080 /1080/_pre/
    !setpredir SITE2 PRE-TV-720 /_PRE/MYGRP/
    !setpredir SITE2 PRE-TV-1080 /_PRE/MYGRP/
    !setpredir SITE2 PRE-X264-720 /_PRE/MYGRP/
    !setpredir SITE2 PRE-X264-1080 /_PRE/MYGRP/

    Possibly you would set up a 2nd slftp instance if you have several groups
    you pre the same sections or sites with or you need to make those sections
    also reflect your group name to make it unique by e.g. using sections like
    PRE-MYGRP-TV-720, PRE-MYGRP-TV-1080, etc. The idea should be clear.

3. Set up precmds on those sites
  Since you don't only want to spread releases to those sites but actually also
  want to issue "site pre" there we need to provide that information to slFtp.

  Since we don't have a separate "dump" site class you will need to set a dummy
  precmd for your DUMP if you're spreading from there.

  Syntax: !setprecmd <site> <section> <cmd>

  Example:
    !setprecmd DUMP PRE-MYGRP site pre <rlsname> MP3
    !setprecmd SITE1 PRE-MYGRP site pre MP3 <rlsname>
    !setprecmd SITE2 PRE-MYGRP site pre <rlsname> MP3

  Example:
    !setprecmd DUMP PRE-TV-720 site pre <rlsname> TV-720
    !setprecmd DUMP PRE-TV-1080 site pre <rlsname> TV-1080
    !setprecmd DUMP PRE-X264-720 site pre <rlsname> X264-720
    !setprecmd DUMP PRE-X264-1080 site pre <rlsname> X264-1080
    !setprecmd SITE1 PRE-TV-720 site pre <rlsname> tv720
    !setprecmd SITE1 PRE-TV-1080 site pre <rlsname> tv1080
    !setprecmd SITE1 PRE-X264-720 site pre <rlsname> 720
    !setprecmd SITE1 PRE-X264-1080 site pre <rlsname> 1080
    !setprecmd SITE2 PRE-TV-720 site pre <rlsname> tv
    !setprecmd SITE2 PRE-TV-1080 site pre <rlsname> tv
    !setprecmd SITE2 PRE-X264-720 site pre <rlsname> x264
    !setprecmd SITE2 PRE-X264-1080 site pre <rlsname> x264

4. Set up specific or generic rules
  We support setting rules for pre sites and sections.
  That means you can, based on rules, allow or deny certain releases to be
  spread and pred on your sites.

  If that's not something you desire or need just set up basic ALLOW rules.

  Example:
    !ruleadd * PRE-MYGRP if default then ALLOW

  Example:
    !ruleadd * PRE-TV-720 if default then ALLOW
    !ruleadd * PRE-TV-1080 if default then ALLOW
    !ruleadd * PRE-X264-720 if default then ALLOW
    !ruleadd * PRE-X264-1080 if default then ALLOW

  Example:
    !ruleadd DUMP PRE-MYGRP if default then ALLOW
    !ruleadd SITE1 PRE-MYGRP if internal then DROP
    !ruleadd SITE1 PRE-MYGRP if default then ALLOW
    !ruleadd SITE2 PRE-MYGRP if default then ALLOW


5. Actually spread/pre your releases
  Basically this assumes you have your releases on your DUMP and want to spread
  from there to then issue "site pre" on all your presites.

  You can do it "manually" by using separate cmds as follows:
  * !spread DUMP PRE-MYGRP This_is_my-Awesome_release-WEB-2019-MYGRP
  * !check DUMP PRE-MYGRP This_is_my-Awesome_release-WEB-2019-MYGRP
  * !pre PRE-MYGRP This_is_my-Awesome_release-WEB-2019-MYGRP

  Or you can make slFtp perform those steps automatically as follows:
  * !batch DUMP PRE-MYGRP This_is_my-Awesome_release-WEB-2019-MYGRP

  If you have several releases to spread and pre you can use wildcards:
  * !batch DUMP PRE-TV-720 Best.Show.Ever.S01*720p*-MYGRP

  By default !batch is a bit less verbose about what it does. If you want to
  know specifics or need to debug certain steps you can add a --verbose flag to
  the cmd.

6. Enjoy, that's it.
