                                    INDEXER
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
slFtp is capable to auto fill requests and therefore maintains an SQLite database
with release names and locations (sites and paths). This is the source what it can
reqfill from, this is called index.
To add releases to the index, you need to add autoindex tasks. For example:
  !setdir HQ ARCHIVE-MP3 /ARCHIVES/MP3
  !autoindex HQ 86400 ARCHIVE-MP3
These two commands above make slftp to index HQ's ARCHIVE-MP3 section every day.

The depth of the section is discovered dynamically: the first nfo will 
determine where the rips are stored. For eg.:
  /ARCHIVES/MP3 has subdirs the following way:
  /ARCHIVES/MP3/2009/01/01/Foobar-Foobar1-2009-SHIT
  /ARCHIVES/MP3/2009/01/02/Foobar-Foobar2-2009-SHIT
slFtp will dirlist /ARCHIVES/MP3 first, then /ARCHIVES/MP3/2009 then
/ARCHIVES/MP3/2009/01 then /ARCHIVES/MP3/2009/01/01 then 
/ARCHIVES/MP3/2009/01/01/Foobar-Foobar1-2009-SHIT, it finds the nfo there,
so it treats /ARCHIVES/MP3/2009/01/01/ as a container dir and adds
Foobar-Foobar2-2009-SHIT into the index.

Then you need to setup REQUEST section on sites where you want the bot to fill 
requests on. This is done with the autodirlist feature, since REQUEST sections
are handled specially. For example:
  !setdir DUMP REQUEST /requests
  !autodirlist DUMP 900 REQUEST
These two commands above make slftp to look for new requests on DUMP every 15 
mins.

The interval you choose will be schedule right away, interval (see !s queue).
If you change the interval it will take effect AFTER the already scheduled run.
When you set it to 3600 and want to change it to 900. If you run the command again,
with 900 as interval, it's going to take effect in 1h.
To change it right away set the interval to "0" essential removing the task, 
then readd it with the desired 900 seconds.

slFtp parses dirnames in REQUEST section with the following restrictions:
- request dir must match the regex ^R[3E]Q(UEST)?-(by.[^\-]+\-)?(.*)$
- the request itself might contain a timestamp prefix in 10 characters format

For example these folders would be valid:
  REQ-2005-01-13_Foobar-Foobar-2009-SHIT
  REQUEST-Foobar-Foobar-2009-SHIT
  REQUEST-by.user-Foobar-Foobar-2009-SHIT

Then slFtp will query the index for Foobar-Foobar-2009-SHIT. If its found, 
it will send to the site where its requested, if a direct route exists
between a source and the site the release was requested on.
If a release is found in more than one source, all of them will be utilized.
If you want to also be able to reqfill from sites that have no direct route to
the site that a release is requested on, make sure to set
[autodirlist] only_use_routable_sites_on_reqfill=0 in slftp.ini

If a release is present on the request site, then a new dir will be created
in the requests directory showing where it can be found and the request will be
reqfilled.

Note: SQLite database is in plain text. If you don't like this, use some file
system encryption.
