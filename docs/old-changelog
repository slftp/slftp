slFTP v1.3.0.11  - small fixes in sltcp
                 - 3 patches contributed:
				   Zohan about tvrage and imdb genre, Sigge about tvrage url
slFTP v1.3.0.10  - autobnctest was broken, bnctest was skipped 
                   if a site status was down (just the opposite action as needed)
                 - imdb lookup was broken (slUrlGet cutted the result)
                 - sending PING to irc server if there was no activity for some time
                 - checking for corrupted slftp.history
slFTP v1.3.0.9   - ACL INCOMPATIBILITY!!! !irc(admin|stats|nuke)chan are removed!
                   read !help ircchanrole
                 - Profiled and optimized taskmanager
                 - Profiled and optimized racetask firing
                 - Profiled and optimized SortQueue calls
                 - using two select/recv calls again instead of select on two 
                   sockets (stability)
                 - slftp segfaulted on irc KICK event :)
                 - logging to console was fucked up
                 - backup dir moved to bin :)
slFTP v1.3.0.8   - duplicate codes of file fetcher tasks (nfoimdb, nfogenre, 
                   lame checker) were merged 
                 - !setnukedir command removed, using the normal section dir 
                    instead.
                 - <ww> added to supported date macros in section dir
                 - log window displayed the dirlisting in one line
                 - no (not that hard) flickering in TslEdit
                 - precatcher/site condititions/skiplists now support perl style 
				   regular expressions in the mapping section, read PRECATCHER and
				   MASKS
                 - INCOMPATIBILITY: precatcher now requires the event parameter.
                   simple ircnet #channel botnick catch rules wont work anymore.
				   you MUST specify the event and some words that are present 
				   in the announce line, read PRECATCHER
                 - precatcher runs mappings section even if it didnt find any 
                   section, so its possible to map section by releasename only
                 - tvclassification condition (by cyric)
                 - backup dir added to the default package, so vista/win7 users 
                   wont get an exception on startup
slFTP v1.3.0.7   - Some commands were renamed in Route management section.
                   !ranks, !rank, !ranklock commands added.
				   read CHAINS file to understand how it works				   
                 - [irc] flood didnt tolerate the setting, lines were sent faster 
				   than the setting wanted. default flood is increased to 500
				   (means max 2 lines sent / second)
                 - !catchreload /creload didnt clear section list before adding 
                   stuffs again
                 - the algorithm how the precatcher extracts the section is changed.
				   [section] SYNTAX HAS CHANGED in slftp.precatcher and mirktrader.conf 
                   read PRECATCHER and change your config.
                 - <yyyy>, <yy>, <mm>, <dd> macros are substitued with today's
                   timestamp in section dirs, so fucked up sites without link to
				   today dir can be supported as well
				   this feature could be a 2nd workaround for the midnight problem
                 - !delrelease and !delallrelease accepted the syntax without an
                   actual releasename and started to wipe everything in the 
				   container dir, yeah!
slFTP v1.3.0.6   - history_maxlines added to slftp.ini
                 - complete tag parser got false positive on drftpd

                 - eprecather's parser was fucked up
                 - small fix in !catchadd, parsing command for event failed 
                   with syntax error
                 - small fix in parseresponsecode, ftp banners of "220 \r\n"
                   caused timeout
                 - speedlock was out of order due to a copy paste bug :]

                   not freed (and not registered either)

                 - small memory leak in slUrlGet, TslTCPSocket was not freed
                 - small memory leak in TPazo.Destroy, TRelease was not freed
                 - small memory leak of speedstatlock on exit
                 - small memory leak in kb_sectionhandlers on exit
                 - critical memory leak in GetClientArea of slVision
                 - maxlines was not set in ftp/irc protocol windows which caused 
                   memory usage to grow constantly
                 - precatcher: checking for nukewords before backfill detection
                 - !transfer started without a releasename...
slFTP v1.3.0.4   - Some fixes in EncryptUDP/DecryptUDP which might have cut 
                   releasenames when using external precatcher 
                 - for releases like Foobar-Foobar-(Live)-DVD-2009-GRP
                   mp3source is DVD and mp3type is Live.
				   mp3live condition returned False for the rip above, it did not
				   check mp3types.
                 - home/end keys did not work on xterm (only in screen), fixed
                 - UpperCase() added to parsing section names in precatcher, 
                   so its not case sensitive anymore                   
                   (of course mirktrader.dll is upgraded again)
slFTP v1.3.0.3   - storing speedstats dropped AV in some special circumstances
                 - false positive in backfill detector for irc lines like:
                   LiNK INFO http://www.xonair.com/detail.cfm?id=10098390 rlsname
				   => validating timestamps
                 - list of mp3languages was missing in slftp.ini damn...
                 - /ctest added for the mirc precatcher (mrc scripts are upgraded 
				   as well)
                 - if an irc line has both pred and ago words, it will be treated 
                   as PRETIME event, dont care about the "inner content" anymore
				   (external precatcher dll is upgraded as well)
                 - help file for tweak was missing
                 - backup feature didnt backup slftp.rules actually...

                 - changing site's username/password without delete: !help tweak
                 - another serious fuckup: slftp was using 160 bit zero as key
                   for encrypting slftp.chans. It is fixed now, so your 
				   slftp.chans file is not compatible with old versions anymore.
				   To convert your current slftp.chans to use the correct key:
				   ./cryptconf(.exe) -fixzero slftp.chans slftp.chans.dec
				   ./cryptconf(.exe) -e slftp.chans.dec slftp.chans
				   (type your password twice)
				   then wipe slftp.chans.dec
				   You need latest version of cryptconf.
                 - !latest cmd adds dirs to cache, so tab completion will work
                 - calling openssl's ERR_get_error as much as it is needed

                   (how the fuck was it missing?!)

                   this way you know if you mistyped it.
                 - indexing task did not check exit event
                 - no queue lock for speedstats
                 - tvrage lookup wont update the show name anymore

                   and dirlisting was given up earlier
                 - deadlock in !ircstatchan and !ircnukechan, thx to lazyness and 
                   copy paste
                 - due to invalid tagging (language code not right before year) in 
				   VA-100_Chansons_Formidables-FR-5CD-2009-gnvr 
				   rip was parsed as 1 CD stuff, this is now workarounded
slFTP v1.2.0.8   - background speed recalc was running all the time
                 - Some little fix in calculating the low boundary in speedrecalc

                 - autodirlist bugfix in 1.2.0.2 was fucked up, and made the app 
                   start racing in every iteration for every rip
                 - autodirlist wont do bnctesting any more. If site status is down 
                   iteration is skipped. Use autobnctest if you want to check status

				   !s linknet somebodytotalkto
				   hey whats up?
                 - ctcp ping reply
                 - readding genrenfo task if we get complete announce on irc and 
                   fetching nfo failed earlier (cause nfo was not available in time)
				   this will also be useful for rips with imdb url
                 - per section pre cmd support
                 - *.[0-9][0-9][0-9] added to _RAR_ macro in skiplists

                 - displaying netname in !ircchannels
                 - !autodirlist'ing a section fires a new dirlist of a rip if the main 
                   directory's timestamp has changed and the previous dirlist was gave up
                 - !kblist takes sectionname as optional parameter to filter the results
                 - bold formatting the announce of dirlisted sites again on stats chan
slFtp v1.2.0.1   - deadlock fixed in !spread which occoured if there were no sites 
                   to spread to
                 - support for gene6 ftp server (its dirlisting is not really standard)
                 - year condition
                 - sample dirs were not traded if there was an irc complete announce 
                   (thix complex bug appaered in 1.1.2.7 with feature "dirlist parser now 
				   removes entries which disappeared"), bug is finally fixed now
                 - noannouncesite /noannouncesection feature added for spam sites/sections

                 - logging ncurses version on *nix, quitting if older than 5.7 is installed
slFtp v1.2.0.0   - stupid interactive irc client
                 - INCOMPATIBILITY!: most options of [irc] section is gone, so is MAIN 
				   irc network.
  				   Irc control is now optional, primary user interface is the builtin 
				   text based one. Ff you want the bot to listen to admin commands on 
				   irc like it used to, you have to add an irc network and then set
				   !ircadminchan command.
                 - Text mode user interface
                 - Free Pascal compatbility, native Linux/Linux64/Windows binaries
                 - handling . and .. on !delrelease (this bug appaered when i fixed 
                   another not removing files beginning with dot, hail lameness!)

                 - sites.dat path feature removed from slftp.ini
                 - this feature is disabled now, since it caused skipping subdirs 
                   (like sample) dirs:
                   not adding new tasks to site where irc already announced 
                   complete, but firing tasks to next destinations automaticly
                 - formatting !finduser, !findaffil, !freeslots output more nicely :)
slFtp v1.1.2.11  - precatcher stripped mirc color codes incorrectly in same special cases
                   in themes used by pay sites
                 - irc complete announce didnt trigger dirlisting again in case of
                   races where source site stalled after time and dirlisting was gave up
slFtp v1.1.2.10  - announce lines like this were recognized as PRE event:
                   Tovo_Trix_-_Live_At_Lazzurra-CDR-21-03-2009-BEC user!tagline - pre'd 15's ago.
                   to fix this, "pre d"->pred rule added to replacelist, so catcher
				   recognizes the line as PRETIME event for now on.
                 - fixed bug in !traders !leechers, added !country, !notes, !name, !speed
                 - new acl: groupchannel support with !sites and !bnctest commands 
                   allowed added for groups purchased the private version :)
                 - !site sitename might display other legacycwd setting than 
                   !legacycwd command
                 - Added default skiplist xxx paysite sections into slftp.skip
                 - Added support for several XXX Paysite sections in slftp.precatcher
                   (you probably need to rename your xxxpix section to xxxpaypix now)
                 - parsing response to idle commands, if we get unexpected one,
                   slot is being relogged in (need some testing on non gl sites)
                 - midnight feature updated path of container dir only on sites 
                   where it did mkdir
                 - when a site is deleted, catch rules were not removed
                 - when a site is deleted, site rules file was not automaticly 
				   saved (rules were deleted in memory only)
slFtp v1.1.2.9   - when a site is deleted the in and outroutes were not removed
                 - timestamp parser failed with dates with 1 digit day number, oh.
				   (and this caused dirlist based trading stop working at beginning of month)
				 - error message added to !catchtest if it cant find matching rules
slFtp v1.1.2.8   - default idlecommands have changed in [idle] of slftp.ini
                 - fixing bug in a feature which is not even announced so far:
                   if a site is down and there is a complete/pre event on its 
				   sitechan, a logintask is fired to test bncs. Now login task is
				   added only if it is not down due to !setdown.
                 - sltcp lib didnt install SIGPIPE handler (oh, what a lameness)
                   which made the app aborted (linux only)
                 - !setdown makes slots logged out
                 - legacycwd is True by default on non glftpd sites now
                   (this fixes the bug sending files listed in sfv to drftpd)
                 - list index out of bands exception with badly tagged rips is fixed now
                   (crap like German_TOP20_BC_06_04_2009-MiNiSTRY )
                 - small fix in logic of deciding which site to add genrenfo/genredirlist
                   task to
                 - !catchtest instead of !catchdebug (help/catchtest.txt added)
                 - Transferring of actual file was not automaticly retried after
                   "you have to turn on secure data connection" (but sslfxp flag was
				   turned on at least for next transfers hehe)
                 - !maxupperrip added (and help/maxupperrip)
                 - not trying to upload the same file to the same destination site
				   (from different sources) in the same time anymore (this usually 
				   occoured in beginning of race with sfv files)				   
                 - In case of broken transfer (crc check bad, cant open data 
                   connection, 0byte files not allowed etc) not removing race tasks 
				   with alternate source
                 - Small fix in complete detection, dirs without sfv in skiplist 
                   (like Sample in TV) were detected as complete with 1 zero sized
				   file
                 - TEncIniFile didnt autosave settings file after erasesection
                   (affected features like !ircchandel)
                 - regpredb's feature added xxx to channels <- fixed again
                 - file distribution algorithm now correctly orders the race tasks
                   by speeds/ranks
slFtp v1.1.2.7   - !transfer treated the src site as PRE, so dirlist was not 
                   repeated til complete detection by tag.
                 - legacycwd default option added to slftp.ini
                 - in two sites setup with only one route added, the bot recognized
                   (incorrectly) that there are no routes it could spread...
                 - ReAdding transfer again to sites which do have a 
				   sitechan (and the bot is listening there) and rip is not
				   completed after x seconds while it is completed on other sites				   
                   try_to_complete_after added to slftp.ini
                 - midnight support, see [midnight] section in slftp.ini
                 - new file distribution algorithm, trying to better utilize 
                   slots in full duplex way 1 up / 1 dn (it still needs improving,
				   it sends some files to low priority sites earlier than it should)
                 - remove_incomplete_stuffs added to slftp.ini
                   if a rip is unchanged and still incomplete after 
				   newdir_max_unchanged seconds, files will be removed by the bot
				   if remove_incomplete_stuffs is true. (default false)
                 - mark_site_down_if_out_of_space added to slftp.ini
                 - taking care of protocol (aborting transfer with PASV command) 
				   on src/dst site if dst/src reports error, 
				   instead of disconnecting the site itself
                 - parsing pzs-ng output for genre in mp3 sections
                 - dirlist parser now removes entries which disappeared
slFtp v1.1.2.6   - some presites were not utilizied in a special case when 
                   dirlisting on 1st presite was slower than on 2nd
                 - stupid bug made the bot not add race task back onto the 
                   "original" site on xdupe event in newdir races
                 - dot added to strip in precatcher config
                 - irc channel names are now case-insensitive
                 - Code is now Free Pascal compatible, binaries supplied are 
                   still Delphi/Kylix builds
                 - small fix in mp3 language code detection 
                   Doide-My_Girl__Otros_Tiempos-WEB-2009-WTW was detected as MY
slFtp v1.1.2.5   - !queue shows latest 10 queue tasks
                 - mp3 language parsing is rewritten in respect of Ouzo.
                 - completly rewritten condition parsing, now supported:
                   parentheses, || operators, negation (not), notin operator,
				   != operator
                 - cryptconf didnt accept anything but same filenames :) fixed.
                 - autodirlist/autologin tasks wont run on sites marked down 
                 - default for newdir_dirlist_readd_for_nfo changed to 15s
                 - You have to turn on secure data connection <- fixed
                 - genre extractor in dirlist mode didnt catch genres with -
slFtp v1.1.2.4   - CG added as language code (damn, are there any more?)
                 - cleaning sfv dependency in racetask correctly if multiple
                   sources were present
                 - using STAT -la instead of STAT -l with !delrelease, so
                   files beginning with dot will be deleted as well.
                 - Scott_Attrill-Big_Bass__Get_To_It-WEB-2009-UKHx was 
                   recognized as an italian CD instead of an english WEB
                 - handling "0byte-file: Not allowed" event same as 
                   crc-check: bad
                 - skiplist names in slftp.skip are treated as pattern now,
                   for eg [TV] will match TV, TVDOCU, TV720, TV1080, TVDSR, etc.
				   Note: order of skiplist section entries are important 
				   for now on! For eg. XXXPIX and XXX
                 - new ACL, users added to the bots channel list with blowfish
                   key are permitted to use the !transfer command (and nothing
				   else)
				   this is useful if you hire some trusted human resource to
				   fill a section hard to make rules for (for example TV docus,
				   since its full of crap series)
                 - if mp3 genre is catched after race is done everywhere, and 
                   new sites become allowed, race was not started to them
				   (this usually happens with 1 file rips)
                 - not adding new tasks to site where irc already announced 
                   complete, but firing tasks to next destinations automaticly
                 - Removing/firing all race tasks to/from a site if irc announces
                   it as complete <- this feature didnt correctly clean the sfv
				   dependencies, and it caused some dead tasks
slFtp v1.1.2.3   - legacycwd command caused deadlock
                 - regpredb's feature added xxx to channels
                 - Removing/firing all race tasks to/from a site if irc announces
                   it as complete
                 - MKD dependency was not cleaned properly when this feature ran:
                   "Removing MKDIR task if irc announce is faster"
                 - "You have to turn on secure data connection" turning on 
                   sslfxp in this case as well
                 - exit sequence of siteslot threads is fixed
                 - empty dirs without sfv were detected as complete
                 - newdir_dirlist_readd_for_nfo in slftp.ini added
slFtp v1.1.2.2   - Ident server was not started since the new tcp library
                   (i forgot an additional start call)
slFtp v1.1.2.1   - One more additional dirlist looking for nfo in non-multidir 
				   rips in newdir races if its still not present when the rip 
				   becomes complete				 
				 - Presite status changed from PRE to COMPLETE if additional
				   info (like genre in 2nd line) was announced or 
				   taskgenredirlist reported the genre
                 - Added event handler for wiping stuffs raced from newdir in 
				   case source is still incompleted after x minutes
                 - running skiplist against xdupe entries as well.
				   yea, thats real life situation with some ftprush (1) files
                 - Firing queue just after both siteslots are done not after 
				   any of them is done, this should utilize speed/priority
				   better
                 - Fixed calculating sim up/dn slots
                 - Support for CRC-Check: BAD! events added
slFtp v1.1.2.0   - *.cue added to slftp.skip in MP3 section
                 - gangsta rap added to the genre list, lol.
                 - socket descriptors were not properly closed on disconnect 
                   this means app ate up all the available file descriptors
                 - ftprush filename fuckups (like 00-filename(1).mp3) added to 
                   hardcoded skiplist                   
                 - rewritten/faster dirlist parsing
                 - new file distrubution algorithm, chain is dynamically 
                   regenerated based on file status on sites, which results
				   slots racing back if "destination" has actually more files
				   than the "source"
                 - HOMEMADE tag added to mp3source_OTHER
                 - INT suffixes removed from slftp.knowngroups
                 - two letter language codes are now case sensitive,
                   while others arent
                 - a few more mp3 language codes added into slftp.ini
                 - JP added to list of mp3 language codes in slftp.ini
                 - default irc timeout increased to 1800 seconds in slftp.ini
				   since it seems efnet server require it
                 - "already on site" is removed as whitelist message on mkd
                 - !language and !foreign conditions
                 - mcps added (next to +OK) as blowfish encrypted prefix
                 - ircnetdel didnt free up resources correctly
                 - new cwd feature of course broke some other features,
                   nfo fetching and lame checking was broken due to invalid
				   filename
slFtp v1.1.1.3   - maxspeed of 10 is corrected in help/setspeed.txt
                 - rewritten CWD handling (it was too complicated, ineffective)
