There are plenty of ircchanroles, and you surely want to know what these roles are for and what they do, so here is an explanation:

ADMIN
Give an IRC Channel ADMIN privilege.
If you want slftp to accept any commands that modifies slftp (add a site, irc channel, catchlist etc.) then a channel needs this role. 
All admin commands from other channels that don't have the ADMIN role will be discarded.

KB
Allows you to send kb commands. So, if you want to add a release to KB or whatever, you need this ircchanrole.

STATS
Announces new KB hits and status message. 
For Example:
[NEW] MP3 Kinda-New-Mp3-2015-MP3Group @ SomeSite (MP3*) (01 Sec ago) (SQLite)
[PRE] TV-SD-ES Latinas.are.Hot.S01E03.SPANiSH.WEBRip.x264-SomeSpanishGrp @ SomeSite
[STATS] MP3 Kinda-New-Mp3-2015-MP3Group (5):
1. Fasttestsite, 2. 2ndFastSite-(1F @ 81.88KB), 3. Otherside, ...

ERROR
If this ircchanrole is set all error messages will be spammed to that channel.

INFO
Spams infos of IMDB-ID's fetched from nfos or addimdb channels, does the same for TV-Maze etc.

INDEXER
Announces Autoindexer process messages.

GROUP
Give an IRC Channel Group privilege: pre, spread, batch, check and so on.

NUKE
Give an IRC Channel Nuke privilege: nuke and unnuke. So, if you want to make use of manual !nuke commands, you have to set this ircchanrole. 
  
IRCEVENT

SPEEDSTATS
Announces changes of speedcalculations for site sections.

RACESTATS
Announces detailed racestats e.g. which file has been transfered from site1 to site2 and how fast.

RANKSTATS

PRECATCHSTATS
Shows you what exactly is going on during races, e.g.

[PAZO] TV-1080P-DE Some.Show.S02E19.German.1080p.WebHD.x264-TVNATiON Sample Dirlist added to : SITE2 (DEST SITE)
[PAZO] TV-1080P-DE Some.Show.S02E19.German.1080p.WebHD.x264-TVNATiON Sample Dirlist added to : SITE3 (DEST SITE)
[KB] TV-1080P-DE Some.Show.S02E19.German.1080p.WebHD.x264-TVNATiON Dirlist added to : SITE4 (NOT PRESITE) from event NEWDIR

ROUTEINFOS
If set, slftp spams routeinfos e.g.: Site1 ->site2(rank) site3(rank) for each race in the correct order.
Please note: 
Routes may change during a race as soon as imdb / tv infos have been fetched.

SKIPLOG
Spams infos on files / dirs that have been skipped due to your settings in slftp.skip.

ADDNFO
Parse NFO via posted HTTP url (deprecated)

ADDPRE
An IRC Channel with ADDPRE privilege allows you to fill the internal dupedb.
This chanrole (on a channel where bots announce addpres) is mandatory if you want to check pretime via SQLite.

ADDPREECHO
Allows slftp to spam !sitepre (or whatever word you defined in your slftp.ini) to a channel whenever it catched one from your pre sources (correct pre-catchline needed).
This will fill the dupe db of others, if they set the addpre ircchanrole.
Example output:
!sitepre Some.TV.Show.S02E13.1080p.HDTV.x264-SomeGroup TV-1080P-ENG
Caution: Not all siteops like that the pres get to be echoed and it might get you purged.
