                             Midnight support
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By default, slFtp does not send CWD commands but uses full paths on glFTPd 
sites. Around midnight this might cause some troubles:
GRP pres a release called Foobar-Foobar-2009-GRP on site SRC at 23:59:50.
slFtp is doing mkdir on site DST at 23:59:50:
DST: MKD /mp3-today/Foobar-Foobar-2009-GRP
and then it starts sending files:
SRC: RETR /today-mp3/Foobar-Foobar-2009-GRP/00-foobar.sfv
DST: STOR /mp3-today/Foobar-Foobar-2009-GRP/00-foobar.sfv
...

Then midnight comes, the mp3-today symlinks point to a new daydir, which would
cause slftp to be unable to complete the transfer.

To prevent this, slFtp has an anti-midnight feature. In the time range 
close to midnight, it will query the server's current dir after mkdir:
DST: CWD /mp3-today
DST: 200 Ok
DST: PWD
DST: 200 Current working directory is: /MP3/2009-0620
DST: MKD Foobar-Foobar-2009-GRP
DST: 200 Ok, directory created.

Then at transfer:
DST: STOR /MP3/2009-0620/Foobar-Foobar-2009-GRP/00-foobar.sfv

And of course, dirlisting on SRC has some similar changes as well, and also
using the real datedir as path on RETR.

To make this work, you need to setup all the sections with dated dirs 
in [midnight] section of slftp.ini:
sections=MP3-*, FLAC, 0DAY, PDA, /(A|E)BOOK/i, XXXPIX, MV

Most scene sites are using Central Europen Time (CET = GMT+1), but their
clock might be inaccurate, so slFtp is doing the procedure for querying
the current dir described above in a specified time range you can setup
in this [midnight] section.

For example, if you live in London/GMT+0 (or your shell has GMT+0 timezone 
set), when scene sites (with GMT+1) are doing newdirs on midnight, your box
has current localtime 23:00. For this reason you need to tweak slftp.ini:

starts=22:45
ends=23:15

Users running slFtp on a shell with GMT+1 do not need to touch both variables above.
